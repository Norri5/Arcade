            <h2>Space Invaders</h2>
            <p>Space Invaders was released in 1978 by Taito. It featured a lone laser cannon at the bottom of the screen firing at waves of descending aliens. 
                The black and white fixed shooter game tasked players with defending against the invading alien armada before they reach the bottom of the screen.
                 As more aliens are destroyed, the pace increases. The iconic pixelated enemies that march in formation left and right while firing projectiles at 
                 the player's cannon made it an instant arcade classic. Space Invaders helped revolutionize the video game industry and launched the golden age of 
                 arcade games.

            <h3> Controls and Endgame </h3>
            <p>Move the laser cannon left and right using the directional buttons
                Press fire button to shoot lasers and destroy invading aliens
                Take cover under bunkers to avoid enemy fire

                <br><br>
                Endgame: The waves of aliens descend row by row as you shoot them. The aliens also shoot back at your cannon.
                
                If the invaders reach the bottom, the player loses a life. If the player loses all 3 lives, the game ends.
                
                The only way to win is to clear all 5 rows of invaders. When they are all destroyed, the game starts again at a higher speed.
                
                The looping stages get faster and harder. The game keeps going until all lives are lost. Players compete for high scores by seeing how long they can survive.
